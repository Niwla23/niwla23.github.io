### PV Dashboard

An Android based dashboard for E3DC PV Solar sytems. It simply shows the current power readings of PV production, EV Charge, Battery Charge, SoC and Grid Consumption.

I have built it using Flutter and it gets the data from the system via a modbus interface. The Flutter app is designed to be used as a launcher app on an old android phone.
